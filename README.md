## About

> This set of tools was made to simplify and automate some daily tasks of linux administrators. It includes **logtail** for extraction relevant information from ***/var/log/syslog***, 
> **stripconf** to get info on only active settings from ***.conf*** files, **hist-filter** for those who hate pressing ***Ctrl-R*** multiple times while looking for particular command in ***history***,
> **ssh-menu** for easy ssh access to your servers, **menu-add** for adding servers to your server list for ***ssh-menu*** and
> **menu-rm** for servers removal from the abovementioned list
> If you have any ideas about what to add to this set, feel free to create an issue or a pull request

### Built With

> Pure bash and bash only. No strings attached. Thus it can be installed to any debian-based liux distro and any architecture

## Getting Started

### Installation

> `git clone https://github.com/sureserverman/adminitools.git`\
> `dpkg-deb --build adminitools`\
> `sudo dpkg -i adminitools`


## Usage

> `logtail -h` or `logtail --help` - to print help\
> `logtail` without arguments to print help again\
> `logtail argument1 argument2...` with as many arguments as you need\
> where argument should be substring that you want to find from your log\
> The output is last 50 lines from log, which contain *argument1* substring, then\
> after key pressed by the user, last 50 lines from log, which contain *argument2* substring etc.
> 
> `stripconf -h` or `stripconf --help` - to print help\
> `stripconf` without arguments to print help again\
> `stripconf argument1 argument2...` with as many arguments as you need\
> where argument should be name of the file, which contains configuration information
> 
> `hist-filter -h` or `hist-filter --help` - to print help\
> `hist-filter` without arguments to print help again\
> `hist-filter argument1 argument2...` with as many arguments as you need\
> The output will be last 50 commands from bash history, that contain *argument1*\
> Then it waits for any key to be pressed by you and prints out last 50 commands, that contain *argument2* etc
> 
> `ssh-menu -h` or `ssh-menu --help` - to print help\
> `ssh-menu` without arguments to choose server from the list interactively\
> `ssh-menu servernumber` to connect to the server which has number *servernumber* in your list\
> The list is stored in /etc/ssh-menu/server-list file
> 
> `menu-add -h` or `menu-add --help` - to print help\
> `menu-add argument1 argument2...` with as many arguments as you need\
> where argument could be either name of file, which contains ssh commands\
> that looks like 'ssh -p port user@127.0.0.1 #description'\
> or the command itself in single or double quotes (you can use both types of argument simultaneously)\
> `menu-add` without arguments for interactively entering elements of ssh command
> 
> `menu-rm -h` or `menu-rm --help` - to print help\
> `menu-rm` without arguments for chosing which server to remove interactively\
> `menu-rm servernumber1 servernumber2...` with as many arguments as you need\
> where argument should be number of existing command in the menu
