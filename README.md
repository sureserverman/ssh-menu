> It includes **ssh-menu** for easy ssh access to your servers, **menu-add** for adding servers to your server list for ***ssh-menu*** and
> **menu-rm** for servers removal from the abovementioned list
>
> If you have any ideas about what to add to this set, feel free to create an issue or a pull request
